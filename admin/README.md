## Overview

The admin setup utilizes React with Vite for fast development using HMR (Hot Module Replacement). ESLint is configured to enforce code quality standards. The directory structure organizes code into `src`, with specific folders for assets, components, and pages dedicated to administrative functionalities, ensuring clarity and reusability across the admin application.

## Getting Started

### If you want to run the whole project, refer to the [root project's README](../README.md#installation).
#
### If you want to run only the frontend of the project, follow the below steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   cd admin
    ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
    ```

##### After running the above, http://localhost:5173 will open automatically in your default browser.

## Directory Structure

- ``src``: Contains all the source code for the admin.
- ``src/assets``: Contains all the static assets used in the application.
- ``src/components``: Contains reusable components used across the application.
- ``src/pages``: Contains the different pages of the application.
